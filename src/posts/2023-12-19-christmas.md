## Discussion

### Intro

For today's playlist, I have it kind of broken down to four pairs of songs with a common theme/message.

### It Feels Like Christmas - *Ghost of Christmas Present*

This year, moreso than past years for me at least, I started feeling that Yule spirit pretty big around Thanksgiving. It has kind of cooled a bit, but it's really hitting me again now, as we're just less than a week away from the holiday.

==What makes you get that "Christmas feeling"? How do you define the Christmas feeling?"==

> In all the places you find love
> It feels like Christmas

> And it is the season of the spirit
> The message, if we hear it
> Is make it last all year

### Go Tell It On the Mountain - Zach Williams

==What are your favorite Christmas songs?==

I rediscovered this song yesterday. It's gospel choir feeling just instantly gave me energy.

For me, Easter is the defining holiday of Christianity. It's the fact that Christ died and was resurrected that - in my opinion, at least - is why Christianity is a religion rather than just a set of beliefs and principles.

But a thought hit me just the other day that brings new importance to Christmas other than just being Jesus's birthday. It is a pivotal step of God putting in action of sending his son to Earth. God is the great planner, and Christmas reinforces that for me. Our salvation required Jesus to die for our sins, and in order to die, He had to first be born. If God can work that plan over *generations*, He surely can work whatever is needed for His plan for my life.

> **John 3:16**
> For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.

**Love** is the reason for the season, and His love for us is worthy of going around, proclaiming its' goodness!

### I Wish - *Stevie Wonder*

==Looking back on when I was a little nappy headed boy  
Then my only worry was for Christmas, what would be my toy?  
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing  
We were happy with the joy the day would bring==

==I wish those days could come back once more  
Why did those days ever have to go?== 

==You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right  
But while you were doin' it, it sure felt out of sight==

### Coldest Winter - *Kanye West*

> Memories made in the coldest Winter
> Goodbye my friend will I ever love again?

> If spring can take the snow away
> Can it melt away all of our mistakes?

> *Goodbye my friend I won't ever love again*

### What's This? - *Danny Elfman*

### My Favorite Things - *Kelly Clarkson*

### Be Kind - *Marshmello, Halsey*

> **Matthew 7:12**
> Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.

### If We Have Each Other - *Alec Benjamin*
