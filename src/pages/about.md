Music is one of the best expressions of the soul, and has been throughout history. Alex curates thematic playlists for each episode of **Music and the Message**, then he and Lem discuss the impact of those songs as well as connections with Biblical messages.

**Music and the Message** is a part of the *God Games and Geekery* podcast.
